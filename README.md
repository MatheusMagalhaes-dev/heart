# HTML/CSS Heart Animation Without JavaScript or Hover
This is a simple heart animation created using HTML and CSS only, without any JavaScript or hover effects. It is a great way to learn about CSS animations and transitions.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, simply open the index.html file in your browser. The heart animation should automatically start playing.

## How It Works
The heart animation is created using the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements in CSS, which are used to create the two halves of the heart shape. The animation is created using keyframes, which specify how the heart should change over time.

The animation consists of the heart changing size and shape, as well as changing colors. The transitions between these different states are created using CSS transitions.

## Customization
If you want to customize the heart animation, you can modify the CSS code to change the size, shape, or color of the heart. You can also modify the keyframes to create a different animation altogether.

## Conclusion
Creating a heart animation using HTML and CSS only is a great way to learn about CSS animations and transitions. With a little bit of creativity and experimentation, you can create all kinds of different animations using just HTML and CSS. <a href="https://matheusmagalhaes-dev.github.io/heart/">Access Here</a>
